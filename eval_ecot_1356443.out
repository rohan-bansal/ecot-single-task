Reasoning: <s> In: What action should the robot take to close the microwave?
Out: TASK: close the microwave PLAN: move to the microwave. grasp the microwave door. move the microwave door towards the microwave. release the microwave door VISIBLE OBJECTS: porcelain mug 1 [[103, 19], [138, 57]], white yellow mug 1 [[120, 87], [156, 128]], microwave 1 [[71, 114], [190, 223]] SUBTASK REASONING: The robot needs to move to the microwave because it is currently positioned too far away to reach and perform the subsequent tasks of grasping, moving, and releasing the microwave door. SUBTASK: move to the microwave MOVE REASONING: The microwave is positioned in the upper right corner of the scene, while the robot is closer to the center, so the robot should move back and up and left to reach the microwave.
